  Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most talked about fields in Computer Science today,
  and for good reason. The idea of having a computer derive patterns in pictures,
  natural languages, media streaming choices, consumer purchases and more, and then
  be able to make a logical prediction is very exciting. Right now, ML techniques
  are used across a wide variety of applications, yet most ML algorithms are inherently
  flawed because of input bias. A computer has no sense of morality, so it naturally won't
  be able to make the most moral, ethical, or diverse choice if that data being inputted
  is inherently human, and therefore biased.

  In my freshman Monroe research project, I realized just how dangerous biases can be
  in ML algorithms; when teaching a computer to play a simple, pre-built
  text adventure game, the computer learned in a biased way based on how I had
  written the game (for example, when I put the dragon on the left side of the
  cave, the computer started to associate leftness with badness). Now, with a
  deeper understanding of these biases, I'd like to see if there are measures
  I can implement in a ML algorithm that writes a simple story to counter biases
  present in traditional storytelling. Basically, what can we do, with full knowledge
  of biases present in ML algorithms, to counter or reduce the negative effects of
  these biases?

  This research project poses quite a few inter-disciplinary questions. First,
  I will research bias in Machine Learning, which requires reading published
  academic papers about the subject. Then, I'll look into Neural Networks and
  Long-Short-Term Memory Recurrent Networks, which are the best ML algorithms
  for processing Natural Language (how I would make the computer write a
  comprehensible story). Then, depending on the text that I trained the algorithm
  on, I'll have to research the kinds of biases found in those texts (ex. Children's
  books from different eras, classic literature, etc.). So all in all, Iâ€™m going
  to do classic research and reading on bias in different forms of literature,
  bias in ML algorithms, Neural Networks and LSTM RNNs, and then learn how to
  actually code a ML model for generating coherent stories using the Keras ML
  frontend in Python.
